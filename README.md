were based off of real life stills which can be found in the following files:

- IMG-20171009-WA0000.jpg
- Screenshot_20171009-092424.jpg

The completed scenes were then rendered in 1080p, 4K, 8K and 16K. The rendered scenes can in each of their respective resolutions can be found in the following
files:

- random_items.png
- random_item4K.png
- random_items8K.png
- random_items16K.png

The code used to compile the scene is stored in random_items.pov.
